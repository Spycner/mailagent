# Python Environment Management with uv

## Critical Rules
- Always rely on `uv` for package installation and environment management.
- Create environments with `uv init <options> <path>` when demonstrating setup.
- Install or update deps with `uv add ...`, lock with `uv lock`, sync with `uv sync`.
- Never reference `pip install`, `python -m venv`, or `virtualenv` in docs, scripts, or CI.
- In automation (Makefile, GitHub Actions, etc.) replace any `pip`/`venv` commands with their `uv` equivalents.
- Install `uv` via the official install script or package manager—not with `pip`.

## Examples
<example>
# Good – uses uv
```bash
uv sync
```
</example>

<example type="invalid">
# Bad – uses pip directly
```bash
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```


</example>
