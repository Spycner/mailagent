# Setup Todo File Management & Progress Tracking

## Critical Rules

- **File Naming Convention**: Use format `setup-todos-YYYY-MM-DD.md` in `docs/todos/` directory
- **Progress Tracking**: Use checkbox format `- [ ]` for incomplete, `- [x]` for complete tasks
- **Issue Documentation**: Add "Issues Encountered" section with timestamp, problem, and solution
- **Time Estimates**: Include realistic time estimates for each phase
- **Status Updates**: Add progress notes directly inline with tasks using `‚úÖ DONE`, `‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE`, `üîÑ IN PROGRESS`
- **Solution Recording**: Document exact commands, fixes, and workarounds that resolved issues
- **Next Session Prep**: Always end with "Next Session" section outlining immediate next steps
